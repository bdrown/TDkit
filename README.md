Software dev kit for handling and analyzing top-down mass spectrometry data

## Do we need another top-down proteomics dev kit?

Probably not. There are already some full-featured devkits out there. I'm in the process of learning C# and thought this would be a decent place to start.
To list a few decent SDKs:

* [Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/topdownproteomics/sdk)
* [mzLib](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/mzLib)
